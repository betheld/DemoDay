# DemoDay Project - Simon Says
- users can create an account to create journal entries which they can keep private or have the option to share with specific friends or entire friend list.
- there is also a tab with mental health support resources
- inspired by my friend Jamal Simon whose mental health became too much for him to bear and is no longer with us. He made it a point to always be kind and show all of his friends endless love and support when all along he needed it most. We used to joke with him for always having something to say even when he wasn't asked for input and with that, my idea was born: Simon Says <3
